Plan (so far): 
- teacher/parent login 
   - two levels of accounts
- mailing features
	- send out unique identifiers to parents to make PTC accounts
	- same w/ teachers
	- will talk w Ryan about how PTC volunteers are linked to teachers
- teacher accounts used by student volunteers (can manually manage queue, students need to manually finish sessions)
- parents can look up teacher rooms and sign up for teachers, get alerts when an appointment is near time

Development: 
- App is set up; create index.html
	- maybe copy paste old css and html files for styling !
- Setup login functionality (db creation)
